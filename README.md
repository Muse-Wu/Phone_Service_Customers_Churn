# Phone_Service_Customers_Churn
 
The project aims to predict for customer who is going to get churned. So that the customer service team can proactively approach the customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction. Churn means that customers stop doing business with the company. The churn rate measures a company's loss in subscribers for a given period of time. The company can use the information to develop focused customer retention programs.
